# pipecryptbackup

This is my first program in Rust. Do not use this at all, anywhere, except for display. You know what I mean.

This program eventually should:

1. Backup and encrypt files in your home directory
2. Decrypt and restore files in your home directory
3. Verify the integrity of the restored files in your home directory

Please see the [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) file, as this license is new to you and is not a typical software license.
